These are the steps to create CI CD pipeline: 


  1. Create project (maven) and implement handler. 
  
  2. Create CodeCommit repo, and push you STS maven projet into AWS CodeCommit
  
  2. Create lambda function and upload jar file that inside a target, also go to basic settings and update the handler: screen.serverless.App::handleRequest
  
  1. Created 2 S3 buckets, one for deploy, one for build
  
  2. Created 2 build, one is deploy build one is build build, both will point the repo on CodeCommit 
  
        build build will have buildspec2.yml file under Buildspec 
        Make sure both have the role that has AWSFULLLAMBDAAccess police 
        
  5. Pipeline 
      - put pipeline name, give it a role ( I choose existing role mouse role ) 
      - for Source put repo from codecommit 
      - for Build put the build build ( screen build ) 
      - for Deploy put S3 deploy bucket and click Extract file before deploy 
      
      
  6. Edit the pipeline and add one stage, on that stage give stage name, and add action, give action name and choose AWS CodeBuild and I choose BuildArtifact and choose deploy build ( in my case screen-deploy )
